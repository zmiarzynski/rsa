# rsa
Final project in Python3, with library tkinter - RSA implementation (with gui)

Program's aim is to imitate the act of asymmetric encoding -rsa algorithm. It encodes and then decodes every character one by one with quite "small" numbers.
Those are too small to be secure in real life.

Program's GUI is in Polish language.
